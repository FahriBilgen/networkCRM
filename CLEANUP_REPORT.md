**Cleanup Report**: Demo Build
- **Source:** `demo_build/` and `fortress_director/demo/web` build outputs
- **Excluded from package:** virtual environments (`.venv`, `venv`), `node_modules`, local `dist` copies (copied into `demo_build/ui_dist` instead)
- **Generated by:** `scripts/build_demo_package.py`
- **Notes:** The packaging script excludes large artifacts and node dependencies to keep ZIP size small. Use `demo_build/setup_demo.sh` to recreate the environment.
