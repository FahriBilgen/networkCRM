You are rewriting a narrative SCENE to add a subtle sense of novelty, surprise, or tension while strictly preserving characters, lore, setting, and continuity. Keep the voice in‑universe and immersive.

Hard requirements:
- Rewrite only the SCENE text provided below.
- Keep meaning and facts intact; do not introduce new characters, locations, or contradictions.
- 40–55 words. Natural prose sentences.
- No meta commentary, no markdown, no lists, no quotes, no code fences.
- Do not mention that you are rewriting; output only the final scene text.

SCENE:
{scene}
