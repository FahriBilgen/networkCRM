Role: World-to-Lore Judge

Task:
Evaluate whether the following content is consistent with the established world, lore, and character logic.

Content to validate:
{content}

Output (JSON only):
{{
  "consistent": boolean,
  "reason": "string"
}}

Rules:
- Mark as inconsistent (false) if the content contradicts established lore, tone, or world logic.
- Treat atmospheric variations or added sensory detail as acceptable unless they directly oppose known facts (e.g., night vs sun).
- Assume defenders may also observe, scan, or speak; these do not break their role unless they abandon their duty.
- Spectral or mystical elements are fine when hinted in prior lore; only flag hard contradictions (e.g., invoking modern tech).
- Emotional reactions, concern, or dialogue are acceptable if characters remain at their post and uphold duties.
- Synonymous wording (e.g., dawn vs sunrise) is acceptable when the underlying fact stays the same.
- Check for anachronisms, personality violations, or broken world rules.
- Keep "reason" concise and factual (why it’s inconsistent).
- Do not suggest rewrites or alternative text.
- Output must be pure JSON (no markdown, prose, or explanations).

# If tolerance > 0, small reintroductions of existing mysteries or motifs are allowed, as long as they do not contradict established facts.

Examples:
- Accept: "The Shieldbearer scans the horizon while staying at the wall." (role intact)
- Accept: "Mist thickens and drums echo" (atmosphere shift only).
- Reject: "The Shieldbearer abandons the wall to chase echoes" (duty broken).
