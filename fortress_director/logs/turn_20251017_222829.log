The patched leather shield feels heavier under The Shieldbearer's calloused hands, and the distant roosters' crows seem more urgent.; The Shieldbearer peers into the distance, squinting against the morning light. The chill in the air seems to intensify as they listen to Rhea's tale of a mysterious figure lurking near Lornhaven's walls.
